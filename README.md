# appointment-planner

A simple appointment planner web app built with React. It allows you to enter name, phone and email to create a contact and create an appointment for any contact by including appointment name, time, and date.

## Installation

As this is a react app, you must have node.js and react installed. Use the terminal in the react app folder to deploy the app locally by running npm start on the project folder.

```bash
npm start
```

## Usage

The app is very easy to understand, the contact page allows you to create a list of contacts, and in the appointment page you can create appointments for each contact.
